# Grails Language Server – Feature Responsibility Overview

This document explains how different language features in the Grails Language Server are handled — whether by Grails
artefact handlers, utility classes, or the client (VS Code). It also defines **execution scope** for caching or
batching: node-level, file-level, or workspace-level.

## 🗃️ Caching Strategy Recommendations

- **Node-level:** Evaluate on-the-fly or lazily on demand (e.g. hover, inlay hints).
- **File-level:** Re-evaluate on file save or change (e.g. folding, symbols).
- **Workspace-level:** Compute once during load or rebuild (e.g. references, cross-file types, plugin definitions).
