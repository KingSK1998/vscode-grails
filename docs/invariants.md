## 1. Field Ownership Map

Every piece of mutable state has exactly ONE owner. Only the owner may write. Everyone else reads.

### Server — State Ownership

| Field / State | Owner | Source of Truth | Readers | Write Methods |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `compiler` (GrailsCompiler) | Per-project `ProjectContextImpl`, partitioned internally across `SourceSetCompilationState` per source set | Groovy CompilationUnit and classloader chain per source set (`main`, `test`, custom) | Compiler-dependent readers through context; verified non-blocking via RequestContext and PublicationAndLifecycleSpec | Project compile/activation/disposal write paths |
| `visitor` (GrailsASTVisitor) | Per-project `ProjectContextImpl` | AST traversal output | Captured request AST accessor, read-only | `visitAST()`, `compileAndVisitAST()`, commit/close lifecycle |
| `fileTracker` (FileContentTracker) | FileContentTracker, wired by GrailsService | In-memory document buffers, monotonic open generation sequence, active generation mappings | Context/provider read access | Document service delegates open/change/close; workspace service delegates file deletion; never providers |
| Legacy `astService` access | Context boundary; verify backing implementation before use | Legacy classification/cache API | Legacy consumers | Do not assume a live independently owned ASTService from an old diagram |
| `projectIndex` (ProjectIndex) | Per-project IndexManager / ProjectContextImpl publication coordinator | Derived value facts from AST | Hover, Definition, References | Candidate index build and project commit |
| Project lifecycle, locks, dependency dirty state (`lastInvalidationOrigin`, `lastInvalidationRevision`), committed overlay URI set | `ProjectContextImpl` | Registered project, work lifecycle, invalidation origins, and successfully published editor overlays | WorkspaceManager, request contexts, close-overload reconciliation | Activation, compile, sync, markDependencyDirty, close reconciliation, hibernate/dispose |
| Active/LKG/history lineage | Per-project `SnapshotManager` | Validated committed generations | Request capture, recovery | Project writer delegates commit; lifecycle release per state contract |
| Project registration, routing, LRU, and cross-project dependency edge evaluation | `WorkspaceManager` | Registered root/build identities and resolved `ProjectDependencyEdge` relationships | Document/workspace dispatch, invalidation propagation, and contexts | Add/remove, access metadata, coordinated eviction, `propagateInvalidation` |
| Active document ticket, per-root lanes, handled revisions, recovery markers/executor | `GrailsTextDocumentService` | FileContentTracker's current buffers plus bounded scheduler metadata | Scheduler health/test observations; WorkspaceManager drain barrier | Admission, coalescing, worker recovery, close/root cancellation/shutdown. Provisional limits: 1 active, 256 pending, 32 ordinary tickets/root, 256 KiB estimated metadata, 4 MiB automatic document input; close tickets may consume the global capacity and overflow collapses to one reconciliation marker |
| Gradle connection/model work, sync futures, retry sequence, and stale state | `ProjectContextImpl` + `GradleService`, wired by `GrailsService` | Resolved project build model, in-flight cancellation tokens, sync generation sequence, bounded retries | ProjectContext readers, SnapshotManager, LSP client | triggerGradleSync, retryGradleSync, cancellation on supersede/dispose, connection close |
| `methodScopeCache` (MethodScopeCache) | Per-project context; entries scoped to file/revision | Local variable/param resolution | Completion, signature help | Evicted on affected document/generation change |
| `groovydocCache` (GroovydocCache) | Per-project context/cache owner | Lazy documentation extraction | Hover, completion | Bounded LRU + input/dependency revision invalidation |
| `config` (GrailsLspConfig) | `GrailsService` | VS Code settings via LSP | All providers (read-only) | `didChangeConfiguration()` |
| `cancellationService` | `GrailsService` | Request lifecycle | All T1 providers | `createCancellationToken()`, `didClose()` auto-cancel |
| `healthService` | `GrailsService` | Provider latency/success metrics | Observability | `recordHealth()` in provider finally blocks |
| `providerRegistry` | `GrailsService` | Lazy provider instances | `GrailsTextDocumentService` | `getProvider()` (lazy init) |
| `discoveryService` and artifact metadata | DiscoveryService, wired by GrailsService | Resolved artifact facts with generation-tracked scan publication and scoped root release (`removeProject`, `projectScanGenerations`) | Completion/resolution | Scan/refresh, generation verification, and scoped release |
| `artifactFactCache` (`ArtifactFactCache`) | `ArtifactFactCache.instance` | JAR artifact content SHA-256 fingerprints | Class/package discovery | Invalidation by content fingerprint change; bounded LRU (500 capacity, 1h TTL) |
| `projectCache` (`ProjectCache`) | `ProjectCache` | Gradle project build model and artifact fingerprints | GradleService | Stale if build files/properties/toml changed or artifact fingerprints mismatch; schema v3 |
| Cross-file caches | Registered cache owner coordinated by project writer | Derived from scoped visitor/compiler inputs | Providers | Coherent invalidation at commit; no unrelated-root clearing as default |

### Client — State Ownership

| Field / State | Owner | Source of Truth | Readers |
|---|---|---|---|
| Service instances | `ServiceContainer` | Constructor wiring | Commands via UseCase |
| LSP client lifecycle | `LanguageServerManager` | VS Code LanguageClient API | Commands, status bar |
| Configuration values | `ConfigurationService` | `workspace.getConfiguration('grails')` | All services |
| Error state | `ErrorService` | Error events | Status bar, output channel |
| Server status | `LanguageServerManager` | LSP connection state | Status bar, commands |
| Webview panels | Per-service (Dashboard, DepGraph, SQL) | VS Code WebviewPanel API | Commands |

### Ownership Rules

| ID | Severity | Rule | Related ADR | Related Failure Mode |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `INV-OWN-001` | 🔴 CRITICAL | **Single writer.** Only owner writes. Providers NEVER write to `visitor`, `compiler`, `fileTracker`. EVER. | ADR-004 | PC-001 |
| `INV-OWN-002` | 🔴 CRITICAL | **Registered ownership.** GrailsService wires server services; each mutable state item has one explicit owner in this table. ProjectContextImpl owns per-project compilation state. No unowned/global mutable analysis state. | ADR-009 | — |
| `INV-OWN-003` | 🟡 HIGH | **No ServiceContainer inside services.** Client services receive deps via constructor injection only. | ADR-001 | — |
| `INV-OWN-004` | 🔴 CRITICAL | **Derived state must have invalidation trigger.** Every cache documents: what invalidates it, who, what scope. | ADR-002 | SM-001, CI-001 |
| `INV-OWN-005` | 🔴 CRITICAL | **AST boundary.** ProjectIndex, SymbolInfo and MethodScopeCache retain no ASTNode references after construction. Origins are value locators, not node links. | ADR-006 | — |
| `INV-OWN-006` | 🔴 CRITICAL | **Snapshot lineage ownership.** SnapshotManager exclusively owns lineage. Current cap is 3 historical entries; LKG preserves last successful usable facts. Retention must also satisfy INV-STATE-010. | ADR-009 | — |
| `INV-OWN-007` | 🔴 CRITICAL | **ProjectConnection Ownership.** Gradle sync exclusively owns `ProjectConnection`. Never shared concurrently. | Phase 3 | — |
| `INV-OWN-008` | 🔴 CRITICAL | **Cross-Project Visibility.** Dependent project reads never block. Always read the last committed snapshot. | Phase 3 | — |
| `INV-OWN-009` | 🟡 HIGH | **Hibernation Ownership.** `WorkspaceManager` exclusively controls LRU hibernation. | Phase 3 | — |

## 2. Stable Identifier Contracts

### What Is Durable vs. Mutable

| ID | Identifier | Durable? | System | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `INV-ID-001` | File URI (`file:///...`) | ✅ Durable | LSP protocol | Canonical key for all document state. Normalized before use. |
| `INV-ID-002` | Class fully-qualified name | ✅ Durable (within compile) | Groovy compiler | Stable within a compilation unit. Changes if user renames class. |
| `INV-ID-003` | `SymbolInfo.id` | ✅ Durable (within snapshot) | ProjectIndex | Unique within index version. Regenerated on rebuild. |
| `INV-ID-004` | AST node identity (`ClassNode`, `MethodNode`) | ❌ Mutable across compilations | Groovy compiler | Valid only within a proven retained generation/request lease; never a durable key or cached across generations. INV-OWN-005 forbids it in value indexes/caches. |
| `INV-ID-005` | Line/column positions | ❌ Mutable | Editor content | Bind to document/analysis revision. Map or revalidate when current text differs; never reuse unqualified old ranges. |
| `INV-ID-006` | Live compiler/visitor/context field references | ❌ Mutable | Runtime | Never retain across requests. Capture one committed request view; do not mix it with later live getters. |
| `INV-ID-007` | Config values (`codeLensMode`, etc.) | ❌ Mutable | User settings | Capture consistent relevant settings per operation; changes invalidate affected derived facts. Do not cache indefinitely or mix settings mid-operation. |
| `INV-ID-008` | Gradle dependency coordinates | Scoped identifier, not content identity | Resolved build model | Changing/snapshot artifacts may change bytes at the same coordinates; include fingerprint/revision. |
| `INV-ID-009` | Workspace folder URI | Durable location, not lifetime | VS Code API | Removal/re-add creates a new root generation; a late callback for the old generation is invalid. |
| `INV-ID-010` | Document version/open generation | Scoped to one open lifetime | LSP + document owner | Version can reset on reopen. URI/version alone cannot distinguish old and new overlays. |
| `INV-ID-010` | Document version/open generation | Scoped to one open lifetime | LSP + document owner | Monotonic openGeneration assigned per didOpenFile. Version resets on reopen are distinguished by openGeneration. Edits with obsolete open generation or obsolete version are rejected. |

### Cross-System Key Rules

| ID | Severity | Rule | Related ADR |
|---|---|---|---|
| `INV-KEY-001` | 🔴 CRITICAL | **URI is canonical cross-system key.** All document state keys on normalized URI. | — |
| `INV-KEY-002` | 🔴 CRITICAL | **Never use mutable state as lookup key.** Line numbers, AST node identity — all mutable. Resolve fresh. | ADR-006 |
| `INV-KEY-003` | 🟡 HIGH | **SymbolInfo IDs are snapshot-scoped.** Valid only within one index version. Do not persist across rebuilds. | ADR-006 |
| `INV-KEY-004` | 🟡 HIGH | **Dependency keys include content and scope.** Coordinates alone cannot key changing artifacts or project visibility. Track dependency revision and artifact fingerprints. | ADR-009 |
| `INV-KEY-005` | 🟡 HIGH | **Provider state is request-scoped.** Providers hold no state between requests. Each request starts fresh. | ADR-005 |

### Identity Resolution Chain

```
User action → canonical URI + position + current document identity
  → resolve project and capture one committed analysis view
  → resolve symbol/range against that view and its input revisions
  → map/revalidate against current buffer or return unavailable/stale status
  → transform scoped value facts into LSP/tool response
```

A request never mixes generations by repeatedly reading live mutable fields. Snapshot-local handles cannot outlive their revision/lease. See the [state contract](state-and-lifecycle-specification.md) for required publication and retention behavior.

## 3. State Consistency Invariants

These are non-negotiable. Violation = bug.

| ID | Severity | Rule | Related Failure Mode |
|---|---|---|---|
| `INV-STATE-001` | 🔴 CRITICAL | **Single-writer principle.** Only designated owners mutate their state through auditable write paths; project publication is coordinated by ProjectContextImpl. | PC-001 |
| `INV-STATE-002` | 🔴 CRITICAL | **Read-never-write.** Providers read via BaseProvider getters. Never call mutating methods. | PC-001 |
| `INV-STATE-003` | 🔴 CRITICAL | **Coherent invalidation.** Derived facts/caches visible with a committed generation match its inputs. Complete affected-scope invalidation before publishing that generation; legacy clearCrossFileCaches calls alone are not proof. | CI-001 |
| `INV-STATE-004` | 🟡 HIGH | **No partial visibility.** Providers never observe half-built ASTs or partially updated indexes. | — |
| `INV-STATE-005` | 🟡 HIGH | **Cancellation-safe.** `CancellationException` propagates cleanly. No partial results committed. | — |
| `INV-STATE-006` | 🟡 HIGH | **Explicit failure/degradation.** Use protocol-appropriate empty/null/error results without raw exceptions. Missing analysis is not authoritative absence; retain cancellation/error/freshness meaning, especially for tools/refactors. | — |
| `INV-STATE-007` | 🟠 MEDIUM | **URI normalization.** All URI comparisons use normalized form. Raw string comparison = bug. | — |
| `INV-STATE-008` | 🔴 CRITICAL | **Reactivation Lock.** `REACTIVATING` state exclusively owns `activationFuture`. FAILED goes to REACTIVATING on edit. | Phase 3 |
| `INV-STATE-009` | 🔴 CRITICAL | **Dirty Propagation.** Propagation visits exactly once per project (no loops). DIRTY state never blocks readers. | Phase 3 |
| `INV-STATE-010` | 🔴 CRITICAL | **Release compiler generations.** Completed hibernation/disposal leaves no owned path retaining released compiler/classloader/CompilationUnit state after bounded in-flight leases drain. Retained active/LKG facts must be detached safe values or an explicitly proven equivalent. Nulling live fields alone is insufficient. | ADR-009 |
| `INV-STATE-011` | 🔴 CRITICAL | **Retention correctness.** Active/LKG usable facts are strongly referenced; optional history alone may use SoftReference. No correctness guarantee or resource budget depends on GC clearing soft references. | ADR-009 |

### Discovery, performance and tool boundaries

| ID | Required contract | Specification |
|---|---|---|
| `INV-DISC-001` | Visible framework/library facts follow resolved project/source-set membership and explicit build edges; no default-project leakage or manual API inventory fallback. | [Discovery](specs/library-discovery.md) |
| `INV-DISC-002` | Artifact facts use content/extractor identity; project membership and dependency revision are separate. Refresh/removal updates all dependent facts coherently. | [Discovery](specs/library-discovery.md) |
| `INV-DISC-003` | Results retain origin, derivation, scope and limitations. Runtime/heuristic behavior is never promoted to an unconditional declaration fact. | [Discovery](specs/library-discovery.md) |
| `INV-PERF-001` | Interactive callbacks/reads do not synchronously compile, resolve Gradle, scan libraries, or activate/hibernate a compiler. | [Performance](specs/performance.md) |
| `INV-PERF-002` | Work admission, retained inputs, results and caches have documented count/byte limits and cancellation/disposal behavior. Latest input remains recoverable under overload. | [Performance](specs/performance.md) |
| `INV-PERF-003` | Optimization and supported resource claims require reproducible measurements with fixture/environment metadata; preserve correctness. | [Performance](specs/performance.md) |
| `INV-TOOL-001` | Editor and agent adapters use the same typed analysis operations and scoped revisions; no independent competing index. | [Agent operations](specs/agent-tools.md) |
| `INV-TOOL-002` | Previews/checks/application have explicit input identities and authorization boundaries; stale edits are rejected/recomputed and partial execution is reported honestly. | [Agent operations](specs/agent-tools.md) |
| `INV-TOOL-003` | Inputs, paths, pagination, result size and execution permissions are validated at the operation boundary, independent of transport annotations. | [Agent operations](specs/agent-tools.md) |
| `INV-EDIT-001` | Text changes preserve protocol order/encoding; virtual/source mappings and edits are bound to the correct document generation. Unmappable edits are not applied. | [State](state-and-lifecycle-specification.md), [IDE](specs/ide-workflows.md) |

### Current evidence gaps, not exceptions
 
| Gap observed in September source/records | Owning acceptance task |
|---|---|
| Interrupted scheduler/runtime cast failure and incomplete lifecycle verification | R0-01, R1-02 (Resolved) |
| Snapshot accessor shallow copies and reader/writer isolation proof | R1-04 (Resolved; see ADR-010) |
| Static discovery loaders and legacy global caches may keep heavy state alive | R1-05 |
| Compiler combines workspace dependencies; guessed project edges and incomplete dependency refresh | R2-01, R2-02, R2-03 |
| Library fallback inventories and unsupported origin/confidence claims | R2-04, R2-05 |
| Typed agent operation boundary/embedded-language completeness not yet established | R3, R4 |

These gaps must be reproduced/verified against the current tree before repair. A task may preserve an unrelated tracked gap; it may not introduce a new violation or mark its own required invariant passed without evidence. [Task cards](execution/task-specifications.md) provide the acceptance cases.
