## State Mutation

### SM-001: AST Service Memory Leak — Artifact Map Duplication
- **Status:** Resolved
- **Bug:** `ASTService` cached `ClassNode` refs by URI. On recompilation, old nodes never evicted → memory leak + query pollution.
- **Invariant violated:** `INV-OWN-004`
- **Root cause:** No eviction in visitor pipeline. `visitSourceUnit` appended without clearing.
- **Fix:** Added `clearUri(String uri)` in `ASTService`. Eviction wired into `GrailsASTVisitor.visitSourceUnit`.
- **Test:** `GrailsIncrementalCompilerSpec` — "ASTService artifact cache rebuilding"
- **Detected by:** Architecture review (Phase 1)
- **Related ADRs:** ADR-006
- **Date:** 2026-06-03

---

## Cache Invalidation

### CI-001: Incomplete Cross-File AST Cache Invalidation
- **Status:** Resolved
- **Bug:** Local AST evicted per-file, but cross-file caches (`DiscoveryService`, completion) had no invalidation trigger. Stale data after cross-file changes.
- **Invariant violated:** `INV-STATE-003`
- **Root cause:** Invalidation was file-scoped only. No cross-file trigger on incremental compile.
- **Fix:** Added `clearCrossFileCaches()` in `GrailsService`, `clearSymbolCaches()` in `DiscoveryService`. Wired at END of incremental cycle.
- **Test:** `GrailsIncrementalCompilerSpec` — "cross-file cache eviction"
- **Detected by:** Architecture review (Phase 1)
- **Related ADRs:** ADR-004
- **Date:** 2026-06-03

---

## Resource Leak

### RL-001: ThreadSafeLruCache Static Executor Lifecycle
- **Status:** Resolved
- **Bug:** Static scheduled executor for cache expiration. `shutdown()` killed it globally — executor rejection on restart.
- **Invariant violated:** `INV-OWN-004`
- **Root cause:** Static final executor, no re-initialization path.
- **Fix:** Non-final static ref with lazy `getExecutor()` re-init. `shutdown()` terminates + nulls. Next access recreates.
- **Test:** `ThreadSafeLruCacheSpec` — multiple restart cycles
- **Detected by:** Test failure on server restart
- **Related ADRs:** ADR-002
- **Date:** 2026-06-03

---

## AST Lifecycle

### AL-001: Stub Test — Zero Regression Protection
- **Status:** Resolved
- **Bug:** `GrailsIncrementalCompilerSpec` contained only `expect: true`. Zero protection for most critical pipeline.
- **Invariant violated:** Testing mandate (CODING_STANDARDS §Testing)
- **Root cause:** Placeholder never filled in.
- **Fix:** Replaced with 7 integration tests covering AST update, cache eviction, node removal, diagnostics, syntax error isolation, position lookup.
- **Test:** `GrailsIncrementalCompilerSpec` (7 cases)
- **Detected by:** Architecture review
- **Related ADRs:** —
- **Date:** 2026-06-03

---

## Provider Contract

### PC-001: Old Constructor Pattern Leaking GrailsService
- **Status:** Resolved
- **Bug:** Providers used `private final GrailsService service` directly. Had access to write methods they must never call.
- **Invariant violated:** `INV-STATE-002`, `INV-OWN-001`
- **Root cause:** Pre-architecture pattern carried forward. No enforcement.
- **Fix:** All T1 providers migrated to `BaseProvider(ProviderContext, CompilationContext, ProjectContext)`. Old field removed.
- **Test:** `@CompileStatic` catches direct state access at compile time
- **Detected by:** Architecture review
- **Related ADRs:** ADR-005
- **Date:** 2026-06-07

## Startup and Interrupted Concurrency Work

### ST-001: Installed Extension Uses Development Startup Defaults
- **Status:** Resolved (verified in R0-04)
- **Bug:** The manifest default selected a manual TCP server; Java configuration was ignored by the launcher, application/LSP port definitions collided, and initial project notifications could arrive before handlers were registered.
- **Invariant violated:** Client lifecycle/configuration ownership; `INV-STATE-006` fail-safe defaults.
- **Root cause:** Development defaults and post-start notification registration persisted into the production path.
- **Fix:** Source changes select the bundled JAR by default, honor the configured Java installation (with quote stripping and spaces support), separate ports and register project handlers before startup. Deterministic artifact copying and VSIX packaging verified.
- **Test:** Headless tests pass via `npm run test:client`; local installation into isolated extensions dir verified with `code --extensions-dir <tempDir> --install-extension vscode-gng-support.vsix` and passing smoke workflow.
- **Detected by:** September startup audit and failing regression tests.
- **Date:** 2026-09-09.

### ST-002: Logs Corrupt Stdio Protocol Framing
- **Status:** Resolved (verified in R0-03)
- **Bug:** A real bundled-JAR smoke test received colored log output where an LSP `Content-Length` header was required.
- **Invariant violated:** LSP transport contract: stdout must carry protocol messages only.
- **Root cause:** Logback console appender defaulted to stdout.
- **Fix:** Console target changed to `System.err`; rolling log retention bounded to 14 days; LSPLauncher builder configured with `.setRemoteInterface(GrailsLanguageClient)`.
- **Test:** `scripts/smoke-server.js` verified with code 0 in 1403 ms (SHA-256: `5B829F88B51443370BD00B0924D72CCBC4E65DBC2D70CEC58017F191B76A549A`).
- **Detected by:** Real JVM transport smoke test.
- **Date:** 2026-09-09.

### ST-003: Duplicate Source Directory Indexing via server/bin
- **Status:** Resolved
- **Bug:** VS Code reported 120 errors ("variable already in scope", "repetitive method name/signature") across Groovy classes.
- **Invariant violated:** `INV-STATE-002` single canonical source of truth for symbols.
- **Root cause:** `server/bin` directory contained a duplicated copy of Groovy source files generated by an external build, causing Groovy/Java compiler to index both `src/main/groovy` and `bin/main`.
- **Fix:** Removed `server/bin`, added `bin/` to `.gitignore`, added `"**/bin": true` to `.vscode/settings.json` `files.exclude`.
- **Test:** `.\gradlew.bat compileGroovy compileTestGroovy` passes with 0 errors.
- **Detected by:** VS Code Problems panel reporting 120 duplicate variable and method scope errors.
- **Date:** 2026-09-09.

### CC-001: Interrupted Background Compilation Migration
- **Status:** Resolved (verified in R0-01)
- **Bug:** Latest saved incremental suite had seven failures with `ProjectState` to `AtomicReference` cast errors. Three scheduler tests additionally used `.empty` map assertions that returned null for an empty map.
- **Invariant violated:** `INV-STATE-004` publication correctness and the regression-test gate.
- **Root cause:** Property access inside lock closure evaluated dynamically under `@CompileStatic`. Repaired with `this.@state.get()` and explicit map/queue tests.
- **Fix:** Restored static compilation in `ProjectContextImpl`; repaired scheduler assertions. All 7 incremental and 9 document compilation tests pass.
- **Test:** `GrailsIncrementalCompilerSpec` (7/7 pass); `DocumentCompilationSpec` (9/9 pass).
- **Detected by:** Targeted tests during migration from inline to queued document compilation.
- **Date:** 2026-09-09.

### CC-002: Unbounded Document Queue and Fairness Starvation
- **Status:** Open (owned by R1-01)
- **Bug:** Large edit storms can flood worker queues with unbounded compilation jobs; lack of byte limits and multi-root fairness.
- **Invariant violated:** `INV-PERF-001`, `INV-STATE-005`
- **Root cause:** Pre-R1 scheduler coalesces by URI but does not bound aggregate queue memory or guarantee cross-root fairness.
- **Fix:** Pending R1-01: bound queue bytes, apply all text edits even when jobs coalesce, establish cross-root fair admission.
- **Test:** To be implemented in R1-01.
- **Detected by:** Architecture audit.
- **Date:** 2026-09-09.

### CC-003: Concurrent Reader Visibility and AST Snapshot Isolation
- **Status:** Open (owned by R1-04)
- **Bug:** Shallow AST visitor copies retain mutable Groovy AST node object identities; concurrent readers during compile/remove could observe partial publication.
- **Invariant violated:** `INV-STATE-001`, `INV-STATE-004`, `INV-OWN-005`
- **Root cause:** Visitor `copyFrom` duplicates collection maps, not deep AST nodes.
- **Fix:** Pending R1-04: reproduce race condition, prove smallest mechanism satisfying coherent nonblocking reads, extract immutable facts.
- **Test:** To be implemented in R1-04.
- **Detected by:** Architecture review.
- **Date:** 2026-09-09.

### DP-001: Cross-Root Classpath Pollution and Guess-Based Project Edges
- **Status:** Open (owned by R2-01, R2-03)
- **Bug:** Two workspace roots with differing dependency versions share an aggregated classloader; cross-project dependencies use name/prefix heuristics instead of resolved Gradle models.
- **Invariant violated:** `INV-DISC-001`, `INV-DISC-002`, `INV-OWN-008`
- **Root cause:** Global classpath aggregation in compiler.
- **Fix:** Pending R2-01 (isolate classpaths per source set) and R2-03 (resolved Gradle build model edges).
- **Test:** To be implemented in R2-01 and R2-03.
- **Detected by:** Architecture review.
- **Date:** 2026-09-09.

## Failure Test Matrix — Use Before Every Feature

| Category | What To Test | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Null/Empty** | Required fields absent | LSP request with no URI |
| **Invariant violations** | Contract broken | Provider writing to `visitor` |
| **External failure** | Dependency down | Gradle crash mid-sync |
| **State transition** | Out of order | Completion before `setupWorkspace()` |
| **Concurrency** | Simultaneous ops | Two completions + `didChange` |
| **Data mutation** | Mutable as key | AST node identity as cache key |
| **Resource exhaustion** | Limits exceeded | 50 rapid `didChange` events |
| **Cancellation** | Mid-op abort | `didClose` during completion |
| **Recovery** | Post-failure state | Provider state after OOM |

### How To Use

1. Give agent this matrix + feature spec BEFORE implementation
2. Agent generates one test per category
3. Review — extend with one case agent missed
4. Run tests — all should fail (not implemented yet)
5. Implement feature
6. Run tests — all should pass
